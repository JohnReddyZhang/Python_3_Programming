Welcome to use the brokerage app!
The app.py meets the requirement that "at least each one method was used once".
I added SOME error checks or exceptions in app, but not complete thorough checks,
so PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION when interacting with the script.

There should not be logic errors when involved methods in brokerage module, as far as I understand the text,
as long as the values are valid. (and input in required form.)

Brief instruction:
in interactive python3: >>> import app,
or in shell: python3 app.py

1. input 'y' if you want to change the exchange's name.

2. input 'y' to add the first stock, please add at least one.
    input 'n' to proceed.

3. press any key to set random prices.

4. input 'y' to add the first broker, please add at least one.
    input 'n' to proceed.

5. input 'y' to add the first desired investor,
    input 'n' to proceed.

6. assign investors portfolios. You can also add non-existing investor in this stage.
    input exit to exit

7. You can do trade and follow the instruction.
    Please, use information that you input already.

8. input exit in the final stage to see "midmarket_value" for each stock, and the script will end.
